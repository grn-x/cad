# My CAD Workspace

This repository serves as a personal workspace for organizing and synchronizing my CAD projects. It contains FreeCAD (and rarely Fusion 360) files, along with occasional STL exports for easy sharing and backup. Projects are sorted by folder, and structured into subdirectories if multiple assemblies are present. 

📁 **Purpose**  
- Personal device synchronization  
- File exchange with friends  
- Backup and versioning  

⚠️ **Note:** This is primarily a working directory rather than a polished showcase. Files may be in-progress, experimental, or unorganized.

Feel free to browse comment or issue if you're interested, but keep in mind it's mostly for practical use. 🚀
